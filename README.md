# AI-Based Covid-19 Diagnosis

## Overview
As of April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
disease. This pandemic has revealed a need for faster and accurate diagnostic methods to detect
pathogens. The focus of this project is to develop an automated COVID-19 diagnostic method
using artificial intelligence tools. An implementation of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model using
transfer learning to detect COVID-19 in chest CT scans is done. The dataset used consists of
4,569 chest CT scans from patients that were separated into three categories: COVID-19 affected
(2163 samples), viral pneumonia affected (909 samples), and normal/healthy CT scans (1497
samples). The implemented neural network model achieved a testing accuracy of 91.8%,
outperforming some other recent models in related works.
